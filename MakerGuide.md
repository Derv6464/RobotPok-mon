## 3D Printing & laser cutting

It was just alot of sanding and filling, I spent about 40hr sanding and filling

1. 3d print all the parts (note these aren't the best models and have some issues)
print pic
2. do a lot of sanding and filling

3. glue the legs, tail, body and chin together

4. do more sanding and filling

5. spray paint with primer
6. do more sanding and filling
7. do a coat of red colour
8. do more sanding and filling for any imperfections
9. do the final coat of spray paint

The order of the final coat colours I did was:

| Paint | Part| Colour |
|-------|-----| ------|
|white primer everywhere| All | white |
|coat of red on body to see imperfections | Body | Red |
|bone white on the face | Head| Bone White |
|red on the arms | Arms | Red |
|light pink on the toungue | Tongue | Light Pink |
|white on the teeth, tape off| Head, Body  | White |
|sprayed the eyes with white, tape off | Head | White |
|sprayed the roof of the mouth dark pink, tape off | Head | Dark Pink |
|dark pink on the inner chin, lip area, tape off | Head | Dark Pink |
|sprayed the inner eyes with black, tape off | Head | Black |
|sprayed the nail area's of the feet with black, tape off | Body | Black |
|sprayed the square area's on the front and tail with yellow, tape off | Body | Yellow |
|bone white on the underbelly, tape off | Body | Bone White |
|red on the rest of the body| Body | Red |

But do whatever works

## Assembly

### Magnets

Orginall there was going to be a sloting system for the hesd to go on the body, hence the weird slots on the back of the head. I ended up glueing magnets in the head and body to hold it together.

I used the lower two slots, did a lot of sanding to make the magnets flush with the body and head and then glued them in with super glue, hot glue and then more super glue.

### Arms

1. The arms to servo parts should connect to a servo cross style servo horn. 
2. Glue these parts together.
3. The arm to servo part can then be sloted into the arms of the pokemon.
4. These should also be glued
5. The arms can be placed into the body, the servo's should be able to be slotted into the holders on the inside of the body

### Motor Assembly

This is not the easiest thing to do

#### Tail Motor

1. Create the lego structure for the motors, see photo
2. Place the dc motor to axel on the motors, they can be glued on if needed
3. Place the motor into the body, can be hot glued in
4. Place the lego structure into the body, have the thread loose around for now
5. Place the axels through the body and into the lego structure
6. Pull the thread around the wheels
7. Put on the red end caps

#### Leg Motors

1. Create the lego structure for the motors, see photo
2. Place the dc motor to axel on the motors, they can be glued on if needed
3. Connect the lego wheel to the motor
4. Place the motor into the body, can be hot glued in
5. Make sure wheel is slotted into gaps fully

### Battery holders

#### 3AAA Battery Holder

Can be glue into the body, on the left side of the tail

#### 6AA Battery Holder

The larger part can be glued deeper into the tail on the right side
The smaller part can be glued into the body on the right side, just before the connector lip
